# CSC116

This is a repository containing c++ source code files that I have implemented for CSC116 assignments.

Dictionary ADT is implemented based on the binary search tree, and is used to implement a simple application of contact list.

(CPP tester files in each folder are implemented by the course coodinator in order to allow students to check their progress.)
